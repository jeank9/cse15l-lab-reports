page skips:
	- from the URL, seems to occur with a hyperlink DONE
		○ …site/#header ???
            - [Link](#header) ?
		○ kind of makes html sense 
	- could be useful for (long) blog post
		○ need table of contents w/all the links (how)
		○ maybe just send them back to the top?



homepage ideas:
    - funny gif
    - links to all posts

other things that could be cool:
    - edit/post time tracker
        ○ blogs always have a timestamp of when posted

to do:
    - revamp index.md DONE
    - create blog post... DONE

to fix:
    - dog won't load :{ DONE
        - relative links don't work? O
    - < o ,, has underscore DONE
    - lowercase header/footers DONE

attempted to make title clickable and it IS.
        <h1 class="header"><a class="site title" href="{{ site.github.url }}">{{ site.title | default: site.github.repository_name }} </a> </h1>
