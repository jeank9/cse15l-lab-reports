fun devlogs/notes for my own use

<<1/14/22>>

page skips:
	- from the URL, seems to occur with a hyperlink
		○ …site/#header ???
            - [Link](#header) ?
		○ kind of makes html sense
	- could be useful for (long) blog post
		○ need table of contents w/all the links (how)
		○ maybe just send them back to the top?

homepage ideas:
    - funny gif
    - links to all posts

other things that could be cool:
    - edit/post time tracker
        ○ blogs always have a timestamp of when posted

to do:
    - revamp index.md
    - create blog post...

to fix:
    - dog won't load :{
    - < o ,, has underscore
    - lowercase header/footers
